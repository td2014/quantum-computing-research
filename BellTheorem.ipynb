    "The subject of non-locality and indeterminism in quantum mechanics is very interesting and continues to be a relevant discussion, although only insofar as validating the vericity under which many modern technologies operate, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.  It is somewhat remarkable that Einstein, who himself radically changed the understanding of the physical world with his work in relativity, would be opposed to the predictions (and experimental verifications) of quantum mechanics.  Once the once thought to be absolutes such as time and space became malleable according to relativity, why would the introduction of indeterminism (\"God does not play dice\") and non-locality (\"spooky action at a distance\") be any different?  At that point, our human powers of intuition are no longer general guides, and mathematical reasoning and experimental verification are the basis for prediction and interpretation of the physical world.\n",
